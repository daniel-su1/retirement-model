# Retirement Model Project

This project is a comprehensive Python-based model for retirement planning. It incorporates advanced financial calculations to project financial readiness for retirement, considering factors like salary progression, savings rates, and investment returns.

## Features

- **Financial Projections**: Calculate and project retirement savings based on current financial inputs.
- **Salary Growth Modeling**: Model salary growth with cost of living adjustments and periodic promotions.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Run simulations to assess the impact of various factors on the age of retirement.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use multivariate regression to analyze the influence of different parameters on retirement timelines.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize financial projections and simulation outcomes using Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels (for statistical analysis)
- Monte Carlo Simulation Techniques
